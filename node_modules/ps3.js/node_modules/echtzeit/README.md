===========

Echtzeit is a highly optimized toolset for pub/sub messaging between web clients built to scale.

This is an enterprise fork of Faye, please see http://faye.jcoglan.com for further information on the general purpose toolset with Ruby/Rack support. However, we endorse any *business to business* dialog and are open for support at `kenan@sly.mn` — please include information about the company you represent and the purpose of your *echtzeit* integration.

Installation
------------

  `npm install echtzeit`

Usage
------------

	With the recent changes echtzeit and Faye, the engine will only listen if it is attached to an arbitrary server. Where echtzeit.listen was used, create a new server [var srv = (http/https).createServer()], attach an initialized instance [var ez = new echtzeit.NodeAdapter({mount: '/', timeout: 45})] to the server with [ez.attach(srv)] and finally listen to a port by [srv.listen(…)].

*Echtzeit* makes it easy to kickstart your realtime environment by providing an abstraction layer which covers all transport-ways you love including WebSocket, JSONP, Polling and XHR. *Echtzeit* is adaptive and implements an intelligent extension system.

You kickstart the *echtzeit* engine by initializing it and attaching it to an arbitrary server of your choice — including *http*, *https* and *spdy*.

	var echtzeit = require("echtzeit"),
	ez = new echtzeit.NodeAdapter({mount: '/app', timeout: 45});

The mountpoint makes it easy to attach to a server without disrupting its functions or service.

	var srv = http.Server(); ez.attach(srv); srv.listen(643);

If you power it up and head to `http://127.0.0.1:643/app/client.js` you'll see *echtzeit*'s client library — which also implies *echtzeit* is working.

This is great! Let's listen to a channel and ditch that rocket-science degree:

	ez.getClient().subscribe("/public", function ( message ) { });

We're using *echtzeit*'s internal client for the server which gets rid of all the initialization clutter we would might face. Great so far, let's get started with the userland.

This ain't rocket-science, too: just include the client library and use the same way to connect to *echtzeit*.

	<script type="text/javascript" src="http://127.0.0.1:643/app/client.js"></script>
	<script type="text/javascript">
		var ez = new echtzeit.Client('http://127.0.0.1:643/app');
	</script>

Now listen on a channel and you're ready to go:

	ez.subscribe('/public', function( message ) { alert( message.text ) });

Go ahead, open some windows and type this into the console of one window:

	ez.publish("/public", { text: "Hey, friends!" });

You can do the plain same on the server:

	ez.getClient().publish('/public', { text: "Hey, friends!" });

* Add `concat-stream` for collecting request data over stream

### 1.5.0 / Superposition

* Client changes:
  * Allow clients to be instantiated with URI objects rather than strings
  * Add a `ca` option to the Node `Client` class for passing in trusted server certificates
  * Objects supporting the `callback()` method in JavaScript are now Promises
  * Fix protocol-relative URI parsing in the client
  * Remove the `getClientId()` and `getState()` methods from the `Client` class
* Transport changes:
  * Add request-size limiting to all batching transports
  * Make the WebSocket transport more robust against quiet network periods and clients going to sleep
  * Support cookies across all transports when using the client on Node.js or Ruby
  * Support custom headers in the `cross-origin-long-polling` and server-side `websocket` transports
* Adapter changes:
  * Add an `origins` option to the server to whitelist authorized origins
  * Escape U+2028 and U+2029 in JSON-P output
  * Fix a bug stopping requests being routed when the mount point is `/`
  * Fix various bugs that cause errors to be thrown if we try to send a message over a closed socket
  * Remove the `listen()` method from `Adapter` in favour of using server-specific APIs
* Server changes:
  * Use cryptographically secure random number generators to create client IDs
  * Allow extensions to access request properties by using 3-ary methods
  * Objects supporting the `bind()` method now implement the full `EventEmitter` API
  * Stop the server from forwarding the `clientId` property of published messages
* Miscellaneous:
  * Support Browserify by returning the client module
  * `echtzeit.logger` can now be a logger object rather than a function

### 1.0.0 / Co-Existence

* Specify ciphers for SSL on Node to mitigate the BEAST attack
* Mitigate increased risk of socket hang-up errors in Node v0.8.20
* Fix race condition when processing outgoing extensions in the Node server
* Fix problem loading the client script when using `{mount: '/'}`
* Clean up connection objects when a WebSocket is re-used with a new clientId
* All JavaScript code now runs in strict mode
* Select transport on handshake, instead of on client creation to allow time for `disable()` calls
* Do not speculatively open WebSocket/EventSource connections if they are disabled
* Gracefully handle WebSocket messages with no data on the client side
* Close and reconnect WebSocket when onerror is fired, not just when onclose is fired
* Fix problem with caching of EventSource connections with stale clientIds
* Don't parse query strings when checking if a URL is same-origin or not

<sup>†</sup> May mutate and evolute at any time.

------------

Feel free to open an issue if you think anything specific to this fork should be discussed. PRs are welcome. See the above notice if you have questions regarding *echtzeit*.

Differences to Faye
------------

* `fireback` flag controlling behaviour whether messages are sent back to the client who emitted them
* `client.js` is cached and piped to every client from memory, rather than reading it from disk
* Overall performance optimizations
* More lightweight
